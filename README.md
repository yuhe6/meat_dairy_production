## Introduction
Our team embarked on a personal journey, transitioning from a meat-centric diet to plant-based choices due to environmental concerns. This shift sparked questions about the broader impact of individual choices and the collective need for sustainable practices. The visualization problem addresses the environmental challenges of meat production, aiming to inspire informed decision-making for a resilient global food system.

## Problem Statement
As the demand for meat rises, so do environmental consequences â€“ greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water depletion. Navigating the balance between nutritional needs and environmental impact is a critical global challenge. Our project seeks to visualize the complexities of meat production and consumption, advocating for sustainable practices.

## Research Questions
- [ ] 1. How has global meat production changed over the past 50 years, and what are the key drivers?
- [ ] 2. Can we visualize the overall trend in global meat production, emphasizing periods of growth or decline?
- [ ] 3. What regional shifts occurred in meat production since 1961, and how can we map the evolving distribution?
- [ ] 4. Are there significant regional variations in meat types, and how can we visualize them globally?
- [ ] 5. What factors contribute to countries favoring specific meat types, and how can we represent this?
- [ ] 6. How do poultry, cattle, pig, and sheep & goat meat shares correlate globally, and what visualizations can communicate this?
- [ ] 7. Do cultural preferences influence meat type distribution globally, and how can we visually represent this?
- [ ] 8. What insights can historical trends provide about potential future trajectories of global meat type shares?
- [ ] 9. Which countries exhibit the highest per capita meat consumption, and how has it changed over time?
- [ ] 10. How does per capita meat consumption vary across income groups, and what are the trends in specific countries?

## Approach
Our dataset on global meat production serves as a lens for historical analysis, identifying drivers of change, understanding regional shifts, and exploring cultural influences. Visualizations include dynamic maps, interactive scenarios, and trend analyses to empower users in actively shaping a sustainable future.

## Conclusion
Our project contributes not only historical insights but also a dynamic resource for anticipating and addressing the challenges of sustainable meat production in the coming decades. The visualizations aim to bridge the gap between personal choices and global responsibility, fostering a collective shift towards a more sustainable and mindful food system. Through this project, we will notice the variety of meat consumers in different parts of the world and what is the variation of consumption over the years, which will give us the idea about how culture and traditions along with science and technology has affected the environment.
