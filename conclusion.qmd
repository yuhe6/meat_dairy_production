# Conclusion


While conducting this project, a natural statistical and analytical conclusion we drew was - Global meat production has experienced an unprecedented surge over the past 50 years, surpassing quadruple growth since 1961. However, this escalation raises critical concerns about its environmental impact, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural land use, and freshwater consumption. The demand for meat, driven by its significance as a nutritional source, has seen a continuous rise, with global production exceeding 340 million tonnes annually.

Regionally, Asia has emerged as the leading meat producer, contributing 40-45 percent to the global total. The distribution has shifted dramatically, with Europe and North America's combined share diminishing from 67 percent in 1961 to 34 percent in 2013, while Asia's share soared from 12 to 43 percent.

Examining meat production by type, poultry has seen a substantial increase, tripling its global share to around 35 percent by 2013, while the share of beef and buffalo meat halved to 22 percent. Pigmeat's share remained relatively constant at 35-40 percent.

On a per capita basis, meat consumption has risen globally by approximately 20 kilograms since 1961, reflecting a pace faster than population growth. Notably, consumption patterns vary widely across countries, with notable increases in China and Brazil, while India maintains low per capita consumption due to prevalent lactovegetarian preferences.

The linkage between wealth and meat consumption is evident, as richer countries tend to exhibit higher per capita meat consumption. The challenge ahead involves producing and consuming meat sustainably, considering its vital nutritional role alongside its environmental impact, to address the pressing global challenge of feeding a growing population in an eco-friendly manner.

Overall, in essence, global meat production has significantly increased over the last 50 years, driven by rising demand and contributing to environmental challenges. Notably, Asia has become the leading meat producer. Per capita meat consumption has grown, particularly in economically transitioning countries, with a strong link between wealth and meat intake. The critical challenge ahead is to balance the nutritional importance of meat with its environmental impact, necessitating sustainable practices for the well-being of our planet.

As the world's appetite for meat skyrockets, our global challenge lies in balancing the nutritional benefits with the environmental toll. Asia now leads in meat production, marking a significant shift. Per capita consumption, intricately tied to economic prosperity, is rising, especially in transitioning nations. The critical question echoes: Can we sustainably feed our growing population without depleting the Earth? It's a delicate dance between nourishment and ecological responsibility that demands our thoughtful consideration.

As we plan for our future experimentation and as we have also noticed the poultry category in our dataset lacked details about the types of poultry, limiting our exploration of consumption trends for each subtype. Looking ahead, we see the importance of exploring other data sources to get detailed information for a deeper analysis. Our journey reflects flexibility, learning from challenges, and the endless possibilities beyond initial setbacks. 

## Authors note: 

We started out wanting to study cancer data in the US, but we hit a roadblock when the server crashed on Dec 12. Undeterred, we switched gears and chose to explore global meat consumption. Here's what we discovered: meat consumption worldwide has been going up for the past 50 years, including fish, beef, and poultry. Interestingly, there's no clear connection between how much people eat of different types of meat. The big players in beef production are the US, China, and Brazil.

Our journey taught us a lot about how world meat data is organized and how to tackle research questions step by step. We faced a challenge at the beginning when dealing with cancer data, struggling for server's API frequently. However, the switch to meat data was a game-changer as it was our back up plans (somewhere with our experience, we knew APIs aren't always trustworthy with respect to server loads â€“ we wrapped up the data part and made visualizations by downloading data as a CSV and uploading it to GitHub. This shows that using the API for data import can be a tough task sometimes, especially during a time constraints.
